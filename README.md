# Bomb-It

This is my homework project for my Programming 3 class. It's a bomberman-like game with ponies. You can play in single player or multiplayer mode.
The auto player is a bit dumb now, it will be improved in the future. Also, you can save and load levels. Made with Java Swing.

Blue pony controls: <br/>
-move: W, A, S, D <br/>
-plant a bomb: SPACE <br/>

Yellow pony controls: <br/>
-move: arrow keys <br/>
-plant a bomb: ENTER <br/>
